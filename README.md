# ECS ASG Container Instance Draining

This is sample code extracted from a couple ECS clusters I work with.
It's worked within the context of other terraform projects, but I haven't
tested it after I broke it out in to this repository (I'll probably get around
to it eventually).

Use at your own risk! The basic architecture is explained in [my blog](https://keita.blog/2019/06/10/managing-ecs-clusters-4-years-in/).
